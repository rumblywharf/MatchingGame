# MatchingGame

This project is a game made with Unity Hub 3.4.1 and Unity 2021.3.21f1. It is a simple matching game using the provided assets.

The game starts off with 16 cards in a 4x4 square and allows the user to click the cardsto turn them around.
The user then has 2 choices upon starting the game- click 1 card and try to match it with the same image.
The cards are randomized and will turn back over upon not matching it off.
The program will then turn cards blank and unclickable when the match is complete.
The user runs through all cards until there is no more crads to flip which is when you know youve won the game.
